Default Weekend Activities
These are available every weekend unless overriden by a special weekend activity with the same name. The overriding special weekend activity doesn't need to actually satisfy its conditions to block a default activity.

Notes
I don't have 'Visit Dungeons', 'Tour Barracks', or 'Visit Treasury' here as they have default behavior, custom behavior based on the story, and need to be potentially unavailable based on the story. I felt it would be mentally simpler to just have them as Special Weekend Activities.
